/**
 * <p>
 * Interface is currently used for One-To-Many binding. BeanProxyWrapper holds
 * target bean and provides setting/getting binding object using {@link List} of
 * proxy objects. If any new value is written, then matching proxy object is
 * found (matching mechanism is identify object by binding property) and
 * transparently set to the targetWrapper. If value is requested (using read
 * method), than is returned original object from targetWrapper.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * BeanProxyWrapper is used for binding, but does not implement
 * {@link HasPropertyChangeSupport}, because of problems with Introspection
 * (Introspection was working good in development mode, but was not working in
 * deployment mode. After few fixes it was working in in deployment mode, but
 * stops working in development mode, so we were not able to provide reasonable
 * fix for this problem) and binding is done using Adapter. Binding mechanism is
 * register adapter provider in his own so there is not necessary to register
 * adapter provider by yourself in your code.
 * </p>
 * 
 * </p> Requested changes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Enhance matching mechanism - match by identifier of the proxy object, not
 * by binding property</li>
 * </ul>
