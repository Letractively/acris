= UI widgets binding =

Project acris-binding represents extension to the gwt-beansbinding library and is focused to binding Beans with GWT UI widgets.

Currently we are supporting 3 types of bindings:
  * *One-to-One binding* - the most simplest type used to bind simple value to the widget that can hold only simple value (e.g. TextBox, CheckBox, ...)
Sample:

{{{
@BindingField(User.NAME)
protected TextBox username = GWT.create(TextBox.class);
}}}

  * *One-to-Many binding* - more complex binding type used to bind object with the list of objects represented in ListBox component.

Sample:

{{{
@BindingField(User.ROLE + "." + Role.NAME)
protected ListBox role = GWT.create(ListBox.class);
}}}

In the sample above we bind role from User with ListBox which holds all available roles. We are matching object through name attribute (in ListBox are displayed role names - in String representation). In order to have complete working example you have to also define data loader, which provides data to the ListBox. By default is defined EmptyLoaderCreator which provides no data. You can define your own data loader which can load data from database (using RPC) or load some predefined data.

{{{
@BindingField(User.ROLE + "." + Role.NAME)
@FieldSpecLoader(CustomDataLoader.class)
protected ListBox role = GWT.create(ListBox.class);
}}}

Now CustomDataLoader is called when ListBox is initialized. See FieldSpecLoader for more details.

  * *Many-to-Many binding* - used to specify binding of List of values to ListBox with multiselect functionality. Also should be used for binding to the table, but currently it is only in experimental state
