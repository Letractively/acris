#summary How to add OpenID login support to your web app.

= OpenID Login =

In this guide we will talk about how to use the projects acris-security-openid and acris-security-ui to integrate both classic username/password and OpenID based login methods, for example through Google or Yahoo, into your Java web application.

For more information about what OpenID is visit http://openid.net.


= Setup =

An example entry point can be found in the acris-showcase-openid project, which showcases setting up a guice servlet and a mock user service to demonstrate logging in through Google, Yahoo, Aol, Seznam, MyOpenID, or by using a classic login method. Let's go over it in detail.


In your module's gwt.xml file, add the following inherit:

{{{
<module>
	<inherits name='sk.seges.acris.security.OpenID' />
</module>
}}}


Since we are using google-guice for dependency injection, we will need this in our web.xml:

{{{
<web-app>
  <filter>
        <filter-name>guiceFilter</filter-name>
    	<filter-class>com.google.inject.servlet.GuiceFilter</filter-class>
  </filter>

  <filter-mapping>
    	<filter-name>guiceFilter</filter-name>
    	<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>

  <listener>
    	<listener-class>sk.seges.acris.openid.server.service.ServletContextListener</listener-class>
  </listener>

</web-app>
}}}

Here we simply enable guice filtering for all requests and inject our guice modules, ShowcaseGuiceServletModule and ShowcaseGuiceModule. Note that we are using guice servlet injection here, this way we can provide a different implementation for certain classes. Google's app engine environment, for example, needs such special implementations.


To be able to use guice dependency injection in servlets, we need two things. First, all server calls will be sent to GuiceRemoteServiceServlet, found in acris-security-openid. This servlet will intercept every call, get the service instance we are trying to access and inject it with whatever dependencies we have defined in our guice modules. This also means that all services injected in this way don't need to extend RemoteServiceServlet, since we are not accessing them directly. Second, all services we want to inject with guice dependencies must be mapped to the same entry point url as the GuiceRemoteServiceServlet, in this case "GWT.rpc".
