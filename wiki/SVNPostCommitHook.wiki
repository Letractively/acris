#labels Phase-Deploy
Description of custom SVN post commits notification using hooks implemented in Java and deployed on Google AppEngine.

= Intructions =

We are using free deployment environment for Java application provided by Google App engine on acris-gwt.appspot.com. If you are acris developer just commit your changes and email notification will be delivered to you.

If you want to set-up SVN mail notifications on your own, follow the next steps:
  * install GEP and GAP (instalation guide is here: http://code.google.com/intl/sk-SK/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/installing.html)
  * download sources from 
{{{https://acris.googlecode.com/svn/branches/svn-post-commit}}}
  * generate eclipse project using maven (command mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse)
  * import your project into the eclipse workspace
  * enable Google App engine support to your project
