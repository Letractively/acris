#summary Automated process of releasing with Maven
#labels Deployment,Releasing

= Prepare maven =

As of AcrIS 1.0.1 version deployment of artifacts consists of two repositories:
  * Googlecode's SVN based one
  * Sonatype OSS free repository

Because we don't want to polute SVN history too much and because SVN is not the right maven repository management we started to migrate artifacts to Sonatype's. As of version 1.0.1 all AcrIS related artifacts will reside in Sonatype's. Other artifacts (SeSAM and CorpIS) will remain in Googlecode's as their release is not made that often. In the future all artifacts will be at Sonatype and synced to Maven Central.

== Step 0 ==

There are two ways:
  * use prepared keystore with Sonatype & Google & Sourceforge certificates -> in this case go to step 3
  * install key(s) manually -> maybe this is the case if you already have keystore for maven

== Step 1 ==

Download Sonatype and Google certificates into your PC. For every downloaded certificate execute following guide below. Name the certificate file e.g. *google.pem*.

[http://acris.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/certificateExportGuide.png]

== Step 2 ==

Following command will import the certificate and asks for a password used to authorize the access to the keystore (and for our example we will use: *keystorePassword*):

    * {{{keytool -v -alias mavenGoogle -import -file google.pem -keystore trust.jceks -storetype jceks}}}

This will create *trust.jceks* on your filesystem. Place it whereever you can find it because it will be needed by Maven!

Delete the certificate file because it will not be needed anymore. The authorization process will be executed against your keystore.

We will follow with 3rd step - setting MAVEN_OPTS up. There are several ways how to do it but these three parameters of Java VM needs to be in place:

    * -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore/trust.jceks 
    * -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword
    * -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks

== Step 3 ==

How to setup MAVEN_OPTS:
    * in case of using prepared keystore use path to acris-os-parent/acris.jceks file
    * for the environment of the operating system (the preferred way):
      * in *Windows*: Start -> Control panel -> System -> Environment variables, put new key MAVEN_OPTS following values -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=c:\path\to\keystore\acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks
      * in *Linux*: in your home directory create file *.mavenrc* and put htere following value MAVEN_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore/acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks

    * or you can set environment variable for specific case/terminal/environment:
      * in Windows console set MAVEN_OPTS=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=c:\path\to\keystore\acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks
      * almost the same in Linux using export MAVEN_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore/acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks"
      * or using direct maven command with variable in Linux: MAVEN_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore/acris.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=keystorePassword -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks" mvn compile

== Step 4 ==

Final step is to setup authentification information for SVN access. Open your *settings.xml* in ".m2" directory and enter following information to the *servers* section:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
			<username>sonatypes-jira-user</username>
			<password>sonatypes-jira-pass</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
			<username>sonatypes-jira-user</username>
			<password>sonatypes-jira-pass</password>
		</server>

		<server>
			<id>acris-snapshots-repo</id>
			<username>darth</username>
			<password>tater</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<id>acris-releases-repo</id>
			<username>darth</username>
			<password>tater</password>
		</server>
	</servers>

</settings>
}}}

The password for Googlecode repository is generated by google and you can find it in "Source" tab and clicking the "google password" link.

You can obtain a password for Sonatype repository by registering at: https://issues.sonatype.org

= Snapshots deployment =

Execute *mvn deploy* optionally with -Dmaven.test.skip in project you want to deploy to snapshots repository. Execute it on parent project if you want to deploy all projects.

= Release =

To deploy to Sonatype (and later to be compliant with Maven central) artifacts need to be signed. Follow the guide on how to create a PGP key and use it with Maven GPG plugin - http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/

== sesam-os-base-parent release ==

  * prepare directory structure
    * use script in https://acris.googlecode.com/svn/releases-repository/sk/seges/sesam/create_base-parent_release_structure.sh
  * {{{mvn release:prepare -DautoVersionSubmodules=true}}}
  * {{{mvn release:perform}}}
  * {{{mvn release:clean}}}

== sesam-os ==

  * go to trunk directory, build pom.xml should be there
  * prepare directory structure
    * use script in https://acris.googlecode.com/svn/releases-repository/sk/seges/sesam/create_release_structure.sh
  * {{{mvn release:prepare -DautoVersionSubmodules=true}}}
  * {{{mvn release:perform}}}
  * {{{mvn release:clean}}}
