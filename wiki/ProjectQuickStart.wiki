#summary How to create AcrIS-enabled project
#labels Project

= Introduction =

AcrIS is Maven-based project but that doesn't mean it is impossible to use Ant or other build tools... but following examples will use [http://maven.apache.org Maven]

= Profiles =

We try to simplify the process of creating new projects so we started to heavily use Maven Profiles. When you use a profile most of the relevant configuration is already present in the profile and you don't have to maintain it on your own.

Pick a specific type of how to configure AcrIS project from the following list (or menu on the left):

  * [ProfilesWebToolkit Google Web Toolkit profiles]
  * [ProfilesAppEngine Google AppEngine profiles]
  * [ProfilesAnnotationProcessing SeSAM Annotation Processing profiles]
  * [QuickStartCustomized Customized quick-start]

Profiles are activated by placing {{{-P}}} argument to {{{mvn}}} command but to simplify the process again, you usually need to *place profile's dot-file* only to the root directory.

Chapters about profiles provide more detailed information.

== How-to use profiles ==

There are only 3 steps:

Create project with POM file inheriting from:

{{{
	<parent>
		<groupId>sk.seges.acris</groupId>
		<artifactId>acris-os-gwt-parent</artifactId>
		<version>${acris-os.version}</version>
	</parent>
}}}

Define which version of AcrIS you would like to use, e.g:

{{{
<properties>
	<acris-os.version>1.2.0</acris-os.version>
</properties>
}}}

Place desired dot-file (empty file with specific name - e.g. {{{.gwt}}} ) to the same directory where POM file is.

That's it!
