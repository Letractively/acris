#summary Selenium support with advanced configuration possibilities

*Strong advice: The ones who does not use/like maven - go away, this wiki page is not for you! Seriously.*

= Creating new project with selenium support =

*Ensure* that you use sesam-os-base-parent (version 1.1.4-SNAPSHOT or higher) as your parent project (__note: or another project that has sesam-os-base-parent as the parent project__)
{{{
<project>
	...
	<parent>
		<groupId>sk.seges.sesam</groupId>
		<artifactId>sesam-os-base-parent</artifactId>
		<version>1.1.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
		<relativePath/>
	</parent>
</project>
}}}

*Create* following files in the root directory (where is your pom.xml located):
 * .pap - this enables maven profile responsible for annotation processor (JSR269) plugins and dependencies, configure required plugins and dependencies
 * .selenium - this provides all dependencies to the selenium and configures reporting plugins


= Eclipse integration =

You can run annotation processors also in the eclipse, eclipse:eclipse command prepares all required settings for the eclipse. You can check the settings in the project properties (alt + enter).

Annotation processor is executed immediately after the java source is saved and generated files are located in the target/generated directory (this should be part of the build path)

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

= Problems =

 * ~~APT maven plugin creates factory path entries with trailing whitespace~~ - this is problem only on linux environment (see reported issue) - [http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MOJO-1609] - *SOLVED* with 1.0-alpha-5-SNAPSHOT version of the apt-maven-plugin
 * ~~Chicken-and-egg problem - if your project has compilation errors there is no easy way how to import project into the eclipse (because processors execution is part of the eclipse:eclipse goal and if it fails no eclipse project file is generated)~~ - *SOLVED* processors are no more bound to the generate-source (generate-test-source) phase therefore you can create eclipse project and run processors separatelly
