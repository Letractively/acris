===Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2011? What do you hope to gain by participating?===
Google Summer of Code is great opportunity for the students to contribute to the open source projects and join the open source community. We will be glad to help them with community adaptation on their starting line. On the other side we hope to grow up our community of developers and get more people involved in the project contribution. We also hope that we will be able to find a new commiteers that come up with the interesting ideas that can improve our project and so they can be helpfull for many people that use Acris in their business applications.

As a matter of fact we are really interesting the modern technologies and expanding community, we are organizing a local GTUG sessions in Slovakia with more that 100 active members (Please, see the details in the meetup page: http://www.meetup.com/GTUG-Slovakia/)

===What criteria did you use to select the individuals who will act as mentors for your organization? Please be as specific as possible.===
Selection was based on the fact that a mentor should have a deep knowledge of the code base. Mentor should also has a strong architecture and development skills so he can sucesfully coordinate students. Selected mentors are the core members of our development team and are really familliar with all implementation details. They have allocated appropriate time slot in order to mentor students, help them with finding the solution and they are prepared to design overall architecture for the selected solution.

===What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?===
The motivation is the key to the success - this is our rule and that is the reason why we are looking only for the motivated students which are really interested in the proposed ideas.

We will constantly motivate students by supporting them with proffesional advices during the development. We know that in spite of intesive support there might by the cases when students loses their motivation and they quit the project prematurely. Even this cannot be avoided we will keeps development in progress and we will continue in the students work if there will be a relevant works done.

We hope, that only early and regular communication with the studsoonercan quarantee the success, therefore multiple synchronization meetings during the week will be required. This helps us to determine problems in the early stages and prevents us (and student also) from unwanted failures.

===What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?===
As was mentioned above, both mentors are very active and long-time project developers thus it is not expected they will disappear. In every case, there are two more mentors allocated in order to help with the mentoring or to substite disappeared mentors.

===What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?===
We understand that it's very difficult for new people to interact with community therefore we would try to keep communication in very friendly manners so the students don't have to worry to ask anything. Because this is the first time we are applying to GSoC, we hope that interesting questions can open new and productive discussions. We will prefer public communication channels in order to communicate with students so it will be possible for other members to join the discussions, bring helpfull ideas, hints and suggestions. We believe that this approach will predetermine community interaction as the most effective way how to share the knowledge or how to quickly solve the problems that occured.

After the project, the most exciting part beggins, student can publish his results to the community for public reviews. This allows him to really grow with the community, to improve the project and to be a part of the community.

===If you are a small or new organization applying to GSoC, please list a larger, established GSoC organization or a Googler that can vouch for you here.===

===If you are a large organization who is vouching for a small organization applying to GSoC for their first time this year, please list their name and why you think they'd be good candidates for GSoC here:===

===Anything else you'd like to tell us?===
We are looking forward to the GSoC and we hope, that our mentors helps to the many students (not only during the GSoC program, but also in the future) and on the other hand, we hope, that many clever students helps us to improve our product and we will be able to introduce more and more features in the future releases. Thank you for this opportunity.
