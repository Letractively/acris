== Pros & Cons & Ideas ==

Comparison to PAP + usecases

* generate code on top of objects that are in the 3rd-party library
* configure different generators for different objects
** example: typically you generate Hibernate DAOs and services for domain objects but you can also generate JSON/JAXB objects and parsers. You need to be able to define it somehow
*** sculptor - a need to change the DSL = not practical
*** PAP - create annotation, write processor
* what if you cannot annotate a class/interface?
** PAP is useless? how to achieve this goal in PAP?
** how to achieve it in MWE? -> custom DSL, sculptor DSL modification -> relatively easy? compare it against creating a mechanism of loading additional project-specific info into PAP
